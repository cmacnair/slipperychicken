slippery chicken installation notes

This is a resource for those who are interested in installing slippery chicken on a Macbook Pro machine. We would like to simplify this process as much as possible, so you can get started fairly quickly.

Unfortunately we do not have an installation guide for Linux and Windows operating systems. Please see the slippery chicken website for installation considerations on these systems.
